# AI Health Screening Assistant
## Overview
Welcome to HealthConnect, an AI-powered chatbot for SDoH screening designed to streamline the pre-appointment process and empower you to take control of your health.
This app is still in the prototype stage, and in a webapp format for now. While primarily focused on UI design and UX, it demonstrates our vision for a more holistic and engaging healthcare journey, where patients can take control of measures to protect their own health preventively.

## Vision
Our chatbot gathers essential pre-appointment information as a check-in and analyzes this data to identify potential [social determinants of health (SDoH)] (https://www.cdc.gov/about/priorities/why-is-addressing-sdoh-important.html). Based on these insights, it will then provide personalized feedback on health risk factors, helping users and healthcare providers make better, more informed decisions. To ensure that these healthy habits are kept, we also implemented a points/rewards system into this app. With every completed pre-appointment check-in, users will earn points that can be redeemed for rewards, such as grocery vouchers and coupons, directly within the app.
